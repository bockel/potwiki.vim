If you like to keep notes in plain text files you might like this script.
potwiki provides functions and mappings for conveniently maintaining 
a Wiki of text files with vim.

The Wiki is a collection of text files in a single directory. These files
can contain hyper links to each other in the form of WikiWords.

A WikiWord is a word which starts with an upper case letter and contains
at least one lower case letter and another upper case letter in this
order -- it's in 'camel case', e.g.

  ThisIsAWikiWord

Such a WikiWord links to a file of exactly the same name in your
Wiki directory.

When opening a Wiki file potwiki scans your Wiki directory to find
which WikiWords are valid links. WikiWords without a corresponding
file are highlighted as errors (otherwise it doesn't matter).

After installing the plugin see :help potwiki for further documentation.

   The default mappings are defined as follow (By default, <Leader> stands
   for '\&#039. See |Leader| for more info) :

   <Leader>ww   - open the Wiki HomePage
   <Leader>wi   - open the Wiki index
   <Leader>wf   - follow a WikiWord (can be used in any buffer!)
   <Leader>we   - edit a Wiki file

   The following mappings are present when editing a Wiki file:

   <Leader><Leader> - close the file
   <CR>             - follow the WikiWord under the cursor
   <Tab>            - move to the next WikiWord
   <BS>             - move to the previous WikiWord
   <Leader>wr       - reload WikiWords
